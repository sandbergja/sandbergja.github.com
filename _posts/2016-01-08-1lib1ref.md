Editing Wikipedia has taught me a great deal of what I know about appropriate sources, open culutre, and the scholarly conversation.  Last term, I had the joy of introducing students in a class to editing Wikipedia, and look forward to introducing a new group of students to it this Winter.  However, while Wikipedia editing nurtures my librarianship and opens my students' eyes, I have been unsure of how to introduce more of my librarian colleagues to the process.

Imagine my excitement, then, to hear of the [#1Lib1Ref](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/The_Wikipedia_Library/1Lib1Ref) project!  It offers an invitation to every librarian to identify one poorly-sourced claim on Wikipedia, and back it up with a reputable, appropriate source.  The editing process has grown much easier over the past few years, with a nifty Visual Editor and many [useful tutorials](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/The_Wikipedia_Library/1Lib1Ref/Help).  The #1Lib1Ref push will take place January 15â€“23, and will undoubtedly be a presence in social media groups.

So, my fellow librarians, the time is now!  I hope you'll join me later this month to improve a widely used knowledge base and enjoy the process of editing Wikipedia.
