##Demos

* We created a basic website using [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and the [MEAN stack](http://meanjs.org/).
* We explored Alaskan geographic, lake, and street name data using the open source [http://qgis.org/en/site/](QGIS) software.  This led to a discussion of some interesting practical applications for a tool like QGIS and some nice sources for GIS data.
* We walked through a [Solr](https://lucene.apache.org/solr/) [schema.xml](https://wiki.apache.org/solr/SchemaXml) file -- actually being used in production -- to learn how solr stores data.  We talked about stemming and other information retrieval concepts

##Activities

For the more coding-focused among us, we attempted two [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) coding problems.  We spent most of the club meeting talking through one of these problems, before taking a stab at a Python or Java solution.

##Discussions and presentations
* We had a lively discussion of [John Deere's proprietary tractor software](http://www.wired.com/2015/04/dmca-ownership-john-deere/).
* We have been intrigued by the [Interplanetary Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interplanetary_Internet) and have spent a lot of time thinking about that.
* A member of ours who was interested in the societal ramifications of open culture brought our attention to the [Open Source Ecology](http://opensourceecology.org/) project.
* Our group has also spent a lot of time talking about Open Educational Resources and their use on LBCC's campus.
