title: Using BibTeX and citeproc to provide accurate citations in a Blacklight-based discovery layer
tags: Blacklight BibTeX

#Background
A number of goals related to proper citations in WR courses:
* WR121 course objective: Cite sources using Modern Language Association (MLA) conventions, including a 'Works Cited' page.
* WR123 course objective: To help students use a systematic research process to present information in a format commonly assigned in college work.
* WR227 outcome: Collect and document information with footnotes and bibliographies.
* WR227 outcome: Use in-text citations and prepare bibliographies following the reseearch conventions in a particular discipline (for example, MLA, CBE, APA).

The Library also has a specific information literacy program outcome: use appropriate/current tools and technologies to create, produce and communicate.

As such, our information instruction sessions devote time to demonstrating use of tools that help to produce appropriate citations and teaching their limitations.

Blacklight includes a built-in citation feature for APA, MLA, and Chicago, based on some hard work from Stanford.  However, there are a number of mistakes in the built-in citations, particularly for non-book items.

##Citeproc

#Overview of a Citeproc-based workflow
Wanted most of this work done during index time, rather than at search time.
