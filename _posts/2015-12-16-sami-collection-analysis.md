Over the past few months, I have had the pleasure of working with one of our librarians, Sami Kerzel, on a collection analysis of our library.
Sami has put a lot of excellent work into this project, discovering a lot of neat tricks using Evergreen's reporter and Excel.
Based on the data she uncovered, she has included a number of recommendations for our Library moving forward.

If you're curious what she learned about our collection, you can
view her report and supporting docs here: http://lbccdfw.omeka.net/items/show/4

She's also kindly documented some of her process in this YouTube video:

Well worth a watch if you want to gain some insight on your collection
development practices (or any other data collected by your ILS,
really).  Thanks for your thoughtful work, Sami!
