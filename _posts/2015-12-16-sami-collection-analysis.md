Over the past few months, I have had the pleasure of working with one of our librarians, Sami Kerzel, on a collection analysis of our library.
Sami has put a lot of excellent work into this project, discovering a lot of neat tricks using Evergreen's reporter and Excel.
Based on the data she uncovered, she put together some very useful recommendations for our library.

If you're curious what she learned about our collection, you can
view her report and supporting docs in her [omeka repository](http://lbccdfw.omeka.net/items/show/4).

She's also kindly documented some of her process in [this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/H83Mldqg4-I).  Well worth a watch if you want to gain some insight on your collection
development practices (or any other data collected by your ILS,
really).

Thanks for your thoughtful work, Sami!
